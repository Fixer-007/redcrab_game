# Redcrab Game

This is a recreated game to run Redcrab.
Mods collected and slightly adapted by Sokomine.
For the licences of each mod, consult the information in the mod's folder!

This modpack contains the mods required to run Redcrabs world (original from Redcrabs server on redcrab.suret.net 30401).
Some mods required modifications (namely moreblocks, stairsplus, homedecor) in order to function with the nodes
found in that world. See the .lua.orig files for the original version.

## Mods

Some other mods where slightly modified (folders renamed where needed, modpack.txt added etc) in order use them
within a modpack.

Some mods come in older versions.

The modpack is not intended for new games. It is most useful for running a local copy of the server's world.
